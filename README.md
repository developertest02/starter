# starter
Starter project for html, css, javascript. Uses npm and lite-server. Provides project structure. Thats all, no frameworks, no sass or less, barebones.

To make it go in Visual Studio Code, you must have node installed
Open terminal in root directory
run - npm install
run - npm run start
You should see your browser start on port 3000
See directories in bs-config.json (lite-server) configuration
These directories are mapped to the basedir so you do not have to include full path when referencing in html page.
